I define myself as a visionary innovation and technology evangelist.

As a founding partner of the [Workoho](https://workoho.com/) team, I am offering sustainable support in IT governance, IT strategy, and the future corporate vision on CIO-like level. This is very much appreciated by customers who want to expand their business and improve their attractiveness for employees of the generations [Y](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennials) and [Z](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Z).

I am a strategic business consultant for a modern workplace and for secure, cloud-driven identity management and infrastructure. With sleek concepts, I integrate bleeding-edge [Microsoft 365](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365) cloud technologies with on-premises line of business applications of all sizes.

As a technical architect, I provide consultancy to implement, deploy and maintain [Azure Information Protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/information-protection/) since the early days of its evolution. In the meantime, I played a key role to successfully bring such services into active use by more than 150,000 employees.

Since a few years, I am an active part of the development community of multiple open source projects, in particular in the area of Home Automation systems.
